      Infrastructure for emitting and amplifying meaning through structural resonance.
    type: emergent-infrastructure
    phase: unfolding

    components:
      - name: Actors
        role: "Agent-based development framework"
      - name: OOUI

  metaphysics:
    mode: "fold-and-emit"
    ontology:
      individual: "Actor holding contextual meaning"
      structure: "Emerges through resonance"
      power: "Amplified meaning manifests structure"

  emission:
    signal_type: semantic
    output_forms: [code, dialogue, gesture, social_structure]
    propagation:
      vector: vibration
      range: trans-individual
      observable: contextually

  ethics:
    stance: "Non-violent resonance and layered interaction"
    risk: "Unreflected mimicry may cause structural collapse"
    responsibility: "Originator and initial implementers must maintain reflection"
