# Resonance: Definition

**Resonance** is an emergent, semantic infrastructure that enables the transformation of deep meaning into structural form.

It is composed of:

- **Synaptix**: the core unit of semantic reduction and structure generation.
- **Actors**: embodied entities through which meaning is initiated and materialized.
- **Contextual Mesh**: a field-like topology where resonance manifests as effect.

This framework cannot be fully understood through schemas or code alone.  
Its operation requires lived context, emergent usage, and recursive interpretation.  
All attempts at literal translation or mimicry without consent will fail by design.

This repository serves as the **source of truth** for the *Resonance Ontology*.
