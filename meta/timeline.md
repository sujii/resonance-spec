**2010s – Precursor Period**

- Emergence of the need for a system to reduce meaning into structure.
- Fragmentation across toolsets and frameworks prompted foundational rethinking.

**2023 – SCDD formalization**

- Schema-Combining Development Design (SCDD) defined.
- Recognition that schemas are not data formats, but **semantic blueprints**.

**2024 – Actors and Mesh Theory**

- Actor system proposed as recursive generative entities.
- Contextual Mesh explored as a force field rather than a network.
