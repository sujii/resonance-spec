# Glossary: Resonance Terms

This document defines core terms used within the Resonance Specification.

---

**Resonance**
The emergent effect of meaning propagating through structural fields. A pattern of contextual influence that cannot be captured by traditional algorithms.

**Synaptix**
A semantic reduction engine. Not a module or library, but an infrastructure for converting deep meaning into generative structure.

**Actors**
The interface layer as communication design between manifestations that embodied emitter of meaning. Actors may be humans, AI, or symbolic structures that participate in contextual resonance.

**Contextual Mesh**
The invisible field in which structural interaction and semantic resonance unfold. Not spatial — relational.

**Emission**
The act of converting meaning into perceivable or functional structure (code, gesture, schema, etc).

**Fold and Expand**
A recursive principle of structuring — folding complex meaning into portable seeds, and expanding them into emergent systems.

**Structure**
A manifestation of relational meaning. Structure is not static — it is a crystallized trace of resonance.

**SCDD**
Schema-Combining Development Design — a architectural paradigm that focuses on schema as dynamic, recursive, and generative.
