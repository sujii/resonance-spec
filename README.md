# Resonance Specification

This "resonance-spec" repository documents the core specifications for a structural framework called **"Resonance"**.

**Resonance** is a system for emitting, amplifying, and embodying meaning as structural influence.

The implementation repository for **Resonance** is not yet publicly available.
This repository defines **origin and intent** as a specification.

> Resonance is an infrastructure that reduces meaning into structure.

All derivative works and implementations must explicitly reference this origin.
