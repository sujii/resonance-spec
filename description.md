This "resonance-spec" repository documents the core specifications for a structural framework called "Resonance".

Resonance is a system for emitting, amplifying, and embodying meaning as structural influence.

It is a generative backbone composed of recursive agents ("Actors"), a semantic reduction engine ("Synaptix"), and a distributed emergent topology ("Contextual Mesh").

"Resonance" is designed for those who operate between language and implementation,
between intuition and architecture —
for those who do not merely write code, but construct signal-bearing structures.

It exists — once perceived.
